                    <aside class="notes">
Before the early 1970s, computers were owned by large institutions
like corporations, universities or government agencies. These machines,
also know as Mainframes, were costly and space consuming, most institutions
owning only one piece of such equipment. Lacking any
kind of intuitive user interface, Mainframes would accept jobs in the
form of punched cards, an early input mechanism for data and programs
into computers. Only a group of people in each institution had
the knowledge on how to operate the machines and they represented
the interface between everyday users and the Mainframe. Quite a bottleneck!

                    <aside class="notes">
In 1971, the first commercial microprocessor was released, representing
the rise of a new era: the Personal Computer (PC). The PC
represented a huge step forward, offering in perspective the possibility
for anyone to own a computer and to operate it using a novel
input/output mechanism: graphical user interface, mouse, keyboard
and other peripherals. This is the standard PC setup that we know
and, after such a long time, still use. By this we want to point out
that although we have came a long way, by hardware and software
advancements, the human computer interaction (HCI) that is mostly
used to interact with PCs is the same as envisioned a little more than
40 years ago.

                        Ubiquitous computing names the third wave in computing, just now beginning. First were mainframes, each shared by lots of people.
                        Now we are in the personal computing era, person and machine staring uneasily at each other across the desktop. Next comes ubiquitous
                        computing, or the age of calm technology, when technology recedes into the background of our lives.

The PCs revolution was followed by the idea of portable personal
devices like laptops and dynabooks (an educational device similar to
a nowadays tablet). Although novel at that time, all the fever generated
by this revolution was viewed by a group of people at PARC1
as being ephemeral: ”[...] My colleagues and I at PARC think that the
idea of a ”personal computer” itself is misplaced, and that the vision
of laptop machines, dynabooks and ”knowledge navigators” is only
a transitional step toward achieving the real potential of information
technology. Such machines cannot truly make computing an integral,
invisible part of the way people live their lives. Therefore we are trying
to conceive a new way of thinking about computers in the world,
one that takes into account the natural human environment and allows
the computers themselves to vanish into the background”.

This futuristic concept envisioned at PARC, which further shaped the
way we see and use information technology and devices, is known as Ubiquitous Computing,
or ”Ubicomp” for short. This introduction was beautifully summarised by MarkWiser

                    <h3>Ubicomp - Vision</h3>

                    <img src="assets/ubicomp_logo.png" />

                    <aside class="notes">
Ubicomp = the vision of this concept is to seamlessly integrate technology into
our everyday lives. Take away the explicit interaction and make it more implicit
based on the current situation of the system

The novel vision in Ubicomp can be viewed as a second major advancement
in the world of information technology. The first major
advancement, the transition from Mainframe to PC, took the relation
between people and computer from a many-to-one to a one-toone
relationship. Ubicomp envisioned a transition from one-to-one
to one-to-many, where each user will own not one but many device.
These device would range from PCs to all sorts of portable device,
some specialized at accomplishing specific tasks and performing under
various circumstances. Classical HCI was not fit for this new setup.
More advanced and more intuitive concepts were needed to make
the best of these technological advances. One such emerging concept
was context-aware computing. Context is ”any information that can be
used to characterize the situation of an entity, where an entity can
be a person, place, or physical or computational object. We define
context-awareness or context-aware computing as the use of context
to provide task-relevant information and/or services to a user. Three
important context-awareness behaviours are the presentation of information
and services to a user, automatic execution of a service,
and tagging of context to information for later retrieval”. Contextawareness
takes HCI to a whole different level. We are not thinking
anymore of only sitting down in front of a computer and interacting
with it using a few peripherals. Users and developers have a whole
new spectrum they can explore, in a dynamic and continuously evolving
technological environment. Take for example a piece of software
that gives information on historical monuments. If this software is
running on a PC, the user would manually search for a specific monument
to retrieve the information. The same software running on
a mobile device with localization capabilities (i.e. GPS), could take
away all the explicit interaction by determining the user’s location
and if this is in near proximity of a certain historical monument, automatically
display the relevant information.
